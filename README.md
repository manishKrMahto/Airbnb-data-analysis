# Airbnb Data Analysis: Key Insights

## Data Quality and Cleaning
The data initially contained inconsistencies, such as:
- Unrealistic future dates (e.g., 2024, 2068)
- Spelling errors in neighborhood names (e.g., "brookln" for Brooklyn)
- Duplicate or potentially erroneous entries

Cleaning these issues was essential for accurate analysis.

## Neighborhood Trends
- The majority of listings (80%+) are located in Manhattan and Brooklyn, which follows the Pareto principle where a small number of neighborhoods contribute to the bulk of listings.
- Popular neighborhoods include Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Harlem.

## Host and Verification Insights
- Approximately 50% of hosts are verified.
- There were instances of single-character host names and hosts with the same ID in multiple entries, indicating possible data entry issues.
- Addressing these issues can improve trust and transparency for users.

## Property and Room Type Distribution
- Listings are predominantly entire homes/apartments and private rooms, making up over 97% of all options.
- This reflects a high demand for both privacy and flexibility in accommodation types among users.

## Pricing Patterns
- Prices for Airbnb listings in New York range from $50 to $1,200, with service fees between $10 and $240.
- Price distributions are generally similar across neighborhoods but vary slightly with room types.

## Minimum Night Stays
- The minimum nights required differ by room type, with entire homes/apartments often having higher minimum night requirements.
- Most listings had a minimum stay of 1-7 nights, aligning with short-term stay preferences.

## Seasonality and Reviews

- Additionally, 90% of ratings are between 2 and 5 stars, suggesting room for improvement in customer experience and service offerings.

## Bivariate Analysis Observations

- Properties built in different years showed similar pricing, indicating that construction year has minimal impact on price within this dataset.

## Improvement Opportunities

- Refining their listings, especially regarding minimum night policies.
- Improving the services offered.
Improving these aspects may contribute to better ratings and a more positive experience for guests.
